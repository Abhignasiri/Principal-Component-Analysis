# Principal-Component-Analysis
## PRML course project

Built Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm from scratch on a dataset with 1000 data points and analyzed the variance explained by each principal component with and without centering the data.

Implemented kernel PCA with different kernels and observed the best suited kernel by projecting points on Principal Components.
